        <h2>◉Switch it Off<br>
          Turn off the lights when natural light is sufficient and when you leave the room. It is that simple!<br><br>
          ◉Climate Control<br>
          Keep your temperature system on a moderate setting while you are in the room.<br><br>
          ◉Wasteful Windows<br>
          Use your windows wisely! If your climate control system is on, shut them…if you need a little fresh air, turn off the heat or AC.<br><br>
          ◉Minimize Plug Load<br>
          Cut down the number of appliances you are running and you will save big on energy. For example, share your minifridge with roomates and minimize the number of printers in your office.<br><br>
          ◉Phantom Power<br>
          Did you know that many electronics continue using energy even when powered down? This is true of any charger, television, printer, etc. Use a power strip to easily unplug these electronics when not in use.<br><br>
          ◉Give it a Rest<br>
          Power your computer down when you are away. A computer turned off uses at least 65% less energy than a computer left on or idle on a screen saver.<br><br>
          ◉Take the Stairs<br>
          Use the stairs as often as possible. Elevators consume electricity. You, on the other hand, do not.<br><br>
          ◉Loaded Laundry<br>
          Only do full loads of laundry and use the bright colors cycle whenever possible.<br><br>
          ◉Shorter Showers<br>
          Try to take shorter showers. The less hot water you use, the less energy is needed to heat the water.<br><br>
          ◉Switch to CFLs<br>
          Compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) use 75% less energy than incandescent and last up to 10 times longer.<br><br>
          <br>
          A few more tips…
          <br><br><br>
          ◉Conserve Paper<br>
          Print and copy on two sides, save single-sided pages for notes, and print only what you need.<br><br>
          ◉Recycle<br>
          Take a few steps to a recycling center in your building to deposit aluminum cans, plastics, glass, office paper, newspaper, cardboard. Pickup of office electronics, bulk metal and surplus furniture can be arranged by contacting Facilities Work Management.<br><br>
          ◉Promote Reuse<br>
          Donate used cell phones and chargers, furniture clothing and cleaning and school supplies.<br><br>
          ◉Get a Little Exercise<br>
          Consider walking or riding a bike to campus if the distance is reasonable. Walk from you bus or subway stop to your office or lab. Faculty and staff carpoolers pay reduced or no fee to park on campus, depending on size of carpool. <br><br></h2>
